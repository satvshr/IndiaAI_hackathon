## Problem Statement
Develop an NLP model that categorizes complaint based on victim, type of fraud and other relevant parameters used for text classification and preparing the final model. 

---

### Key Challenges
1. **Diverse Complaint Types**: Cybercrimes vary widely, making classification complex.
2. **Class Imbalance**: Certain types of complaints are overrepresented, while others are underrepresented, affecting model performance.

## Our Solution

Our solution employs advanced Natural Language Processing techniques to build a classification model that efficiently categorizes complaints. By leveraging structured data and machine learning, the model can:

1. **Subcategories and Categories**: Predict detailed subcategories and map them to broader categories like online financial fraud, cyberbullying, phishing, etc.
2. **Context-Aware Predictions**: Utilize embeddings and preprocessing to extract key contextual insights for accurate classification.

### Key Features
- **Automated Classification**: Reduces manual workload by automating complaint categorization.
- **Real-Time Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets with minimal latency.
- **Customizable Workflow**: Supports integration with external data sources for contextual enrichment.

### Benefits
- **Improved Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of 0.86 with strong performance in key subcategories.
- **Streamlined Processes**: Accelerates the complaint handling process by flagging critical cases.
- **Insightful Analysis**: Identifies patterns and trends in cybercrimes, supporting preventive measures.
